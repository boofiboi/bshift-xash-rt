### Half Life: Blue Shift ray traced using the [xash-rt](https://github.com/sultim-t/xash-rt) engine built by [sultim-t](https://github.com/sultim-t).

#### This repo is used as a staging ground for all the changes I need to do to maps, files, models in the Blue Shift campaign for Half-Life in order to get it functional and playable in the engine. [Opposing force might've been easier to start with, but YOLO]




### What does this require?
#### You will need to:

 1. Compile hlsdk-portable's bshift branch (Found [here](https://github.com/FWGS/hlsdk-portable/tree/bshift)) as x64, as this engine branch cannot run 32 bit game DLL's
 2. Use a tool such as [bspfix](https://valvedev.info/tools/bspfix/) to convert all Blue Shift maps into a format that the new engine understands.
 3. Download the required files for every map/model to fully utilise the ray traced engine.
 4. **Most importantly, have some patience with the game. A lot of features that bshift uses are non-existent/broken in this engine fork, and I do not posses enough skills/knowledge to fix them/add them into the engine (I'm a web developer, not a C developer) [Although I might learn one day]**

#### I might be able to provide  the compiled engine DLL, but you have to get the rest.

## I am using this as an opportunity to learn!
### This means this will never reach professional quality like the main game converted by sultim-t himself!
#### I am only here to learn how to mess around with GLTF, PBR textures and RTGL1.
#### Do not expect professional grade quality from this conversion, it is my first time doing this sort of stuff.
